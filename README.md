Title: 
Marvel to Media


Description:
In this project, we have created an application meant to provide the user with more information about their favorite Marvel characters.
Using local storage, we were able to save and retreive the searched characters and create a button with the characters' name on it, so the user can easily research.


How to Run:
Note: If you are live viewing index.html from a local computer, please change address bar to http://localhost:5500/index.html.
A user can go on to the website and type a choice of a Marvel character in the search box and press the search button. Every searched character on the application is saved right below the search box and a button is created dynamically so that the user can press on the character's name instead of retyping it.
Then on the left hand side of the page, users can read about their character's story, view how many comic books, series, and stories that character has. Right below that information, users can click on the given links to sample a book for themselves.

On the right hand side of the page, users can view 3 sample movies and read about the movie, its rating and release date.
